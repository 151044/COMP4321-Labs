# COMP 4321 Labs
Please see the original labs for tasks and instructions.
## Lab 1
Rewritten to use [JDBC](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/index.html) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).

We use the [`sqlite-jdbc`](https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc) library to connect Java with SQLite.

This requires *some* SQL knowledge, but I guess you should learn the basics.

## Lab 2
Rewritten to use [JSoup](https://jsoup.org/).

## Lab 3
Implemented with reference to the [NLTK Python implementation of Porter's algorithm](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.stem.porter.html#nltk.stem.PorterStemmer).
